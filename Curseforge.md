**Itemswapper is a free and open-source inventory tweak mod for the Minecraft
client that adds an item switch interface**

## Features

- Switch between items from the inventory
- Show the inventory from an empty hand
- Switch between items from shulker boxes in the inventory(requires the mod/plugin on the server)
- Item wheel for block pallets
- Item list for dynamic items like tools, food, potions, etc.
- Fully customizable via resource packs

Tweaks to the inventory system are based
on [Xisumavoid's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6DvnFCW5FY).

## Usage

**⚠️ This mod is still in development and may change over time. Feel free to open an
[issue](https://github.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/issues)/[discussion](https://github.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/discussions)
on Github with any suggestions or bugs you find.**

Itemswapper adds an interface for switching items, which is opened by pressing a hotkey (by
default: `R`). Depending on the item in the main hand, the interface displays different options. For
unlisted items, the interface is not displayed at all.

You can switch between items by **moving the mouse** or **by scrolling** through list. Releasing
the hotkey will swap the item in the main hand with the selected item.

Pressing the **middle mouse button** while an item is selected will switch to the related items, if
they
are available.

Creating your own resource pack allows you to customize the existing interface or adds support for
non-vanilla items.
