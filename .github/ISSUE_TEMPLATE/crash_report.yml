        ## Instructions (read me before you open an issue!)


        This is a template for the issue you are about to open! It will help you
        provide the information necessary to complete your **crash report**.
        Before you open an issue, ensure you've completed every step on the
        checklist below.


        - Have you used the [search
        bar](https://github.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/issues) to find
        similar issues? If you find one that looks like what you are getting,
        consider contributing additional information to it instead. Make sure
        you are not opening a duplicate.

        - Are you using the latest version of the mod? If not, try updating to
        see if it resolves your issue. You can find the latest versions
        [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/itemswapper/versions).


        Have you tried the top two bullets yet and the issue is still there? Then continue to fill 
        the issue by providing the following information about it:
  - type: input
    id: version
    attributes:
      label: Version information
      description: >-
        Please provide the exact version of the mod you are using. Every part of
        the version is important! If you do not know what version you are using,
        look at the file name in your `mods` folder.
      placeholder: 'Example: itemswapper-fabric-0.7.6-mc1.21.3'
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: input
    id: mods-installed
    attributes:
      label: Other mods installed
      description: >-
        Please provide the names and versions of those mods. If you do not know what version you are using,
        look at the file name in your `mods` folder.
      placeholder: 'Example: modmenu-4.1.2'
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: textarea
    id: repro-steps
    attributes:
      label: Reproduction Steps
      description: >-
        Provide information on how to reproduce this game crash. You can either
        fill this section in like the example below or do something else just
        make sure your instructions are minimal and clear, as other people will
        need to be able to replicate your issue.
      placeholder: |
        Example:
        1. Press the hotkey to open the overlay
        2. Click an item
        3. The game crashes
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: textarea
    id: report
    attributes:
      label: Crash Report file
      description: >-
        Upload your crash report file as an attachment to this issue (drag-and-drop) or to a service such as GitHub
        Gist (paste a link) and replace this section. This information is critical in resolving your issue!
        
        Messages like "Exit code 0" from your launcher are not what you're looking for. If your launcher does not
        provide a button to view the most recent crash report, check your game's `crash-reports` folder for the most recent
        crash report file.
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: textarea
    id: additional
    attributes:
      label: Additional information
      description: >-
        Provide any additional information or context which may be relevant to
        the issue. If you have none to add,  you can leave this section blank.
