        ## Instructions (read me before you open an issue!)


        This is a template for the issue you are about to open! It will help you
        provide the information necessary to complete your **crash report**.
        Before you open an issue, ensure you've completed every step on the
        checklist below.


        - Have you used the [search
        bar](https://github.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/issues) to find
        similar issues? If you find one that looks like what you are getting,
        consider contributing additional information to it instead. Make sure
        you are not opening a duplicate.

        - Are you using the latest version of the mod? If not, try updating to
        see if it resolves your issue. You can find the latest versions
        [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/itemswapper/versions).


        Have you tried the top two bullets yet and the issue is still there? Then continue to fill 
        the issue by providing the following information about it:
